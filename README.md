# CI/CD Pipeline Overview

Creating a robust and reliable CI/CD pipeline to ensure integrity and safe deployment involves several key components and strategies. Here's an overview of a typical CI/CD setup:

## 1. Version Control System
- **Function**: All code changes are pushed to a version control system, triggering the CI/CD process.

## 2. Continuous Integration-CI
- **Automated Build**: Every code commit triggers an automated build process.
- **Automated Test**: After the build, various tests (unit tests, integration tests, and UI tests) are run to ensure code quality and functionality.

## 3. Continuous Deployment-CD
### Environments
- **Setup**: Multiple environments are set up (development, testing, staging, and production). Some companies use infrastructure as code to maintain consistency across these environments.

### Deployment Strategies
- **Canary Releases**: Changes are rolled out in small stages to a subset of users before a full rollout.
- **Blue/Green Deployment**: Traffic is switched between two identical environments that differ only by the software version. This approach simplifies immediate rollbacks if needed.
- **Rolling Updates**: Updates a few instances at a time, gradually replacing the old version of the app with the new one.

## 4. Monitoring
### Real-time Monitoring
- **Tools**: Use monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK to track application performance and user activities in real time.

### Alerts and Notifications
- **Setup**: Alerts are set up for failures detected during or after the deployment.

## 5. Feature Toggles
- **Implementation**: Feature toggles are used to enable or disable features without deploying new code. This approach allows for easier management of features in production and supports A/B testing and canary releases.
